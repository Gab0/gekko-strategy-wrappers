This is a template for gekko trading bot strategies that runs strategies inside them, so you can add mechanisms (stoploss, volume threshold to try trades, run multiple strats, etc..) to existing strategies.

Some examples are added.

ps: There is a problem with the mechanism. If you run nullTest.js with some strategy, and the strategy itself alone, you'll notice a slight divergence between backtesting results. So consider this highly WIP.
