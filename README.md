To facilitate the composition of strategies that are based on strats glued together.
Or to add a simple conditional to existing strat that is reusable to any other (i.e only buys when volume is above threshold);

Examples added, and community examples are welcome;

### Setup

Move `strategyWrapperRules.js` to gekko strategy folder.

### Usage

Check the examples.

### Examples

WRSI_BULL_BEAR: a remake of RSI_BULL_BEAR, now using the wrapper. 
Strangely it behaves differently (unintended), trading less with higher profit.
